# Secure-Login-Project
This is a secure (fingers crossed) login that I made for my Project 01 in my Cybersecurity class. I plan to update it later but I just wanted to get it out there  
To run, make sure you have nodejs + sqlite and all dependencies installed  
Run node server.js in terminal
Connect to http://localhost:1738 (or whatever port you specified in code)
